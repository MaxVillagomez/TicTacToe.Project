What should my code be given ahead of time?
1. A game display
2. win conditions
3. code to check if those win conditions have been met
4. Auto assign player 1 to X and player 2 to O

What do I want my code to do?

1. allow players to hit reset button at any given moment to clear the board and restart
2. Prompt users to enter names
3. Remove username input 
4. Display player's name in "Player's turn" to indicate whose turn it is
5. Player 1 should be able to place an X anywhere on the grid
    i. code should check to see if there is already an element in the grid container
    ii. if no, place the current players designated letter
    iii. else do not place anything 
6. The board game should update and display the X where player 1 placed it
7. Switch to player 2
8. Player 2 should be able to place an O in an empty grid container 
    REPEAT
    i. code should check to see if there is already an element in the grid container
    ii. if no, place the current players designated letter
    iii. else do not place anything 
9. The board game should update and display the O where player 2 placed it
10. Begin checking if win condition is met
    i. code should run through win conditions and check to see if any has been met
    ii. if no win condition has been met yet, keep allowing the players to play
11. once win condition has been met by either player, display "Player wins!"
